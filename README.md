OpenID AuthZEN XACML JSON Proxy
=================

This project contains a Node.JS app based on Typescript and Express. It exposes an endpoint that conforms to the OpenID AuthZEN specification, processes the request, converts it to a XACML/JSON request, sends it to a compatible PDP, and processes the response it receives back.
